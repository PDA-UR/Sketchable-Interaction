# data of regions like shape coordinates

CANVAS := region => type(Canvas)  # main  (macro style?) ergo C := region => main

A := region => type(MoveableRegion) & shape => type(present) := [(x0, y0), (x1, y1), ... , (xn, yn)]
B := region => type(MoveableRegion) & shape => type(blueprint) := []

# B assignment could be written as
# B := region => type(MoveableRegion)
